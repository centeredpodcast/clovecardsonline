            <p>Hello and welcome to Cove Cards! Here's how this deck page works:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>At the top is a list of your cards!</li>
                <li>Click on a card to add it to a deck!</li>
                <li>Next are your decks!</li>
                <li>You can create an empty new deck by clicking on the New Deck button.</li>
                <li>Switch your active deck for player one and player two by clicking on the Switch Active Decks button.</li>
                <li>Click the Create a 10 Card Deck button to create a new deck with 10 random cards in it, ready to be active!</li>
                <li>Your active decks will be tagged as your active decks.</li>
                <li>Only decks with 10+ cards can be active. Buttons will appear to make the deck active.</li>
                <li>If your deck has more than 10 cards and is active, you cannot play with it. You will have to reduce the amount of cards to 10 again to play with it.</li>
                <li>Click on Delete Deck to delete the deck. Be careful, this action is irreversable!</li>
                <li>You cannot delete active decks!</li>
                <li>For each card in each of your decks, you can remove it from that deck by clicking on it!</li>
                <li>If you have multiple of a card, the card name will have a counter next to it (e.g. x5 if you have 5 of one card).</li>
                <li>Each card is split by |s!</li>
            </ul>
